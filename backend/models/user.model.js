/*
    When you add timestamps: true in a Mongoose schema it automatically adds two fields to your schema:
    createdAt: This field stores the date and time when the document was first created in the database.
    updatedAt: This field stores the date and time when the document was last updated.
    How It Works:
    When a new document is created, both createdAt and updatedAt are set to the current timestamp.
    When an existing document is updated, only the updatedAt field is updated to the current timestamp.
    You don't need to manually set them â€” Mongoose handles updating these timestamps whenever you create or update a document.
